**Terminal Game Battleship**

This python script will execute a fun little Battleship game in your Terminal.

It was written as a benchmark assessment for the first four weeks of the coding bootcamp ByteAcademy. 

It was a lot of fun to make and I tried to add as many functionalities as possible.

The database runs on sqlite3.
